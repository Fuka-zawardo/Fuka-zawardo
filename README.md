### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a QA and a software developer. My passion is building things that work!
Quite obvious. I started as a QA, transitioned to software development and at the moment, I do both. 
With expertise in both frontend and backend + testing, it makes my work more smooth and more understanding how things should work and how things can be limited.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IoT project, developing amazing API for the heating systems and more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: fukazawaradoslaw@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Polish guy living the dream in Japan.
- I have my own "company" in Japan, mainly focused on the QA.
